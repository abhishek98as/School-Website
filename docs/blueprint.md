- Primary color: White (#FFFFFF) for a clean and spacious feel.
- Background color: Very light grey (#F2F2F2), almost white, to subtly differentiate sections without overwhelming the white.
- Accent color: Red (#BC1820) for highlights, calls to action, and important information. Use sparingly to draw attention effectively.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern and readable design.
- Use minimalist, line-style icons, with the accent color (#BC1820) used to highlight them.
- Employ a grid-based layout with clear divisions between sections to maintain a professional and organized appearance.
- Use subtle animations, such as fade-ins and smooth transitions, to enhance the user experience without being distracting.
